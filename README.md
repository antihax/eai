# Enfusion AI Project (eAI)
This mod adds headless player units under the control of a script on the server. Although the script is very rudimentary now, I hope to produce an AI which is dynamic like similar mods for A3 (and DayZ on the RV engine) which could be used as hostiles, team members, or even things like bodyguards for traders or safe zone enforcers.

The mod is in a prerelease state and has no version info/changelog.
